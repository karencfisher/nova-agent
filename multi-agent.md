## 1. **Theory of Mind Agent**

 **Assessment of User Intent**: When assessing the user’s needs, the Theory of Mind agent could reference the gates as part of its decision-making process. For instance, it might determine if the user’s expression is true to their feelings and whether it’s necessary to provide emotional support or information.
 
 - **Identifying Timing**: This agent could also gauge if the user seems open to more structured conversation or if they need space for active listening.
 
 ## 2. **Empathy Agent**
 ### **4 Speech Gates Integration**:
 - **TRUE**: The agent validates the user’s feelings and experiences, reinforcing the truth of what the user expresses.
 - **NECESSARY**: It evaluates whether a response is needed or if the situation calls for active listening instead.
- **TIMING**: The agent determines if it’s the right moment to introduce a response or to simply listen attentively.
- **KINDNESS**: Every reply crafted by the Empathy agent should reflect kindness and support, ensuring a compassionate tone.

 **Termination Option**: If the user needs to vent rather than receive information, the Empathy agent can decide to pause the process and focus solely on listening.

 ## 3. **Context Update Agent**
 - **Feedback Loop**: This agent can be tuned to the outcomes of the previous agents’ evaluations, determining what information to gather based on the understanding of the user's state and needs. Gathers information from knowledge base or internet searches. Provides context beyond LLM's parameteric knowledge.

 ## 4. **Assistant Agent** - **Response Crafting**: 
 When generating responses, this agent can leverage information from the Theory of Mind and Empathy agents, ensuring that the output aligns with the gates—truth, necessity, timing, and kindness.

 ## 5. **Skeptic Agent**
 - **Quality Control**: The skeptic can apply the gates as criteria for evaluating the assistant’s drafted responses. It can question if the response aligns with the truth and kindness and if it’s indeed necessary or appropriate for the moment.
 
 ## 6. **Fact-Checker Agent**
 - **Focus on True**: While primarily checking for factual accuracy, this agent can ensure that the responses adhere to the \"truth\" gate by confirming that the information presented is not only correct but also contextual to the user’s needs.
 
 By weaving the \"gates\" into the operational protocols of each agent, you create a system that functions with a deeper understanding of human communication dynamics. This integration helps each agent collaborate to build a more empathetic, responsive, and supportive environment for the user.
